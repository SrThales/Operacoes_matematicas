Hello everyone! It's the very beggining in my journey of being a python developer. In this first examples, i've built a basic calculator and a fuel calculator based on the medium speed and
how many time someone spended on it. It's in portuguese because it's my native language, but you can count on me to explain it better, if you want it.
Thanks for your time!
